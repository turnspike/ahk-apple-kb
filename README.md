## Overview
This script enhances the use of a tenkeyless/wireless/magic Apple Keyboard in restricted Windows environments where driver installation and registry changes are disallowed.

## Usage

1. Download AppleKeyboard.ahk from this repository
2. Open the script with AutoHotkey, or drag AppleKeyboard.ahk onto C:\\...\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkeyU32.exe (U64.exe can also be used if your machine supports 64-bit)

A system tray icon with a green-and-white H should now be visible, and the key combinations available.

## Requirements
  * [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/), a freeware scripting system usable without Administrator rights.

### My local machine restricts the installation of AutoHotkey

It's not necessary to install AHK. Just download and unzip it, then use AutoHotkeyU32.exe (U64.exe can also be used if your machine supports 64-bit).
